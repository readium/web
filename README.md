# üåê Readium Web

Readium Web is a toolkit for building Web Readers. It currently supports EPUB, with plans for PDF, audiobooks and comics/manga/webtoons in future revisions.

This repo is a work in progress, but it will host documentation and project management for the Readium Web project.

Readium Web is divided into two separate toolkits:

- the [TypeScript toolkit](https://github.com/readium/ts-toolkit)
- and the [Go toolkit](https://github.com/readium/go-toolkit)

## Why do we need two toolkits?

The TypeScript and Go toolkits are meant to be complementary rather than competing toolkits.

The primary use case of the `go-toolkit` in a Web Reader implementation is to:

* stream packaged resources (EPUB, CBZ)
* output a [Readium Web Publication Manifest](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest) for each of them over HTTPS
* along with various complementary API responses ([Positions List](https://readium.org/architecture/models/locators/positions/), [Guided Navigation](https://readium.org/guided-navigation))
* and stream individual resources of these publications over HTTPS


Whereas the primary use case of the `ts-toolkit` in a Web Reader implementation is to:

* interact with a [Readium Web Publication Manifest](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest) and related APIs
* provide various navigators to handle various publication types (reflowable publications and fixed layout for now)
* along with the lower level API associated to these navigators (for example the [Preferences API](https://readium.org/architecture/proposals/009-preferences-api.html) or [Decorator API](https://readium.org/architecture/proposals/008-decorator-api.html))

We could say that the `go-toolkit` turns a publication into an API, whereas the `ts-toolkit` is the engine of a Web Reader.

## Readium Playground

The playground is a work in progress meant to illustrate the capabilities of Readium Web. In its current state, it provides a very basic vanilla reader that allows the user to navigate through publications.

Future work on this project will progressively bring it up to par with a reference implementation. Our current ETA for this work is to have something ready by the end of 2024.
