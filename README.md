# üåê Readium Web

Readium Web is a toolkit for building Web Readers. It currently supports EPUB, with plans for PDF, audiobooks and comics/manga/webtoons in future revisions.

This repo is a work in progress, but it will host documentation and project management for the Readium Web project.

Readium Web is divided into two separate toolkits:

- the [TypeScript toolkit](https://github.com/readium/ts-toolkit)
- and the [Go toolkit](https://github.com/readium/go-toolkit)

## Why do we need two toolkits?

The TypeScript and Go toolkits are meant to be complementary rather than competing toolkits.

The primary use case of the `go-toolkit` in a Web Reader implementation is to:

* stream packaged resources (EPUB, CBZ)
* output a [Readium Web Publication Manifest](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest) for each of them over HTTPS
* along with various complementary API responses ([Positions List](https://readium.org/architecture/models/locators/positions/), [Guided Navigation](https://readium.org/guided-navigation))
* and stream individual resources of these publications over HTTPS


Whereas the primary use case of the `ts-toolkit` in a Web Reader implementation is to:

* interact with a [Readium Web Publication Manifest](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest) and related APIs
* provide various navigators to handle various publication types (reflowable publications and fixed layout for now)
* along with the lower level API associated to these navigators (for example the [Preferences API](https://readium.org/architecture/proposals/009-preferences-api.html) or [Decorator API](https://readium.org/architecture/proposals/008-decorator-api.html))

We could say that the `go-toolkit` turns a publication into an API, whereas the `ts-toolkit` is the engine of a Web Reader.

## Thorium Web and the Readium CLI

In addition to these toolkits, implementers can also build their projects directly on top of [Thorium Web](https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-web) and the [Readium CLI](https://github.com/readium/cli).

Thorium Web is an open-licensed Web Reader that's built on top of the TypeScript toolkit, providing UI components and all of the features that you would expect from a reading app.

The Readium CLI can stream EPUB publications over HTTP/HTTPS or connect to a storage such as S3, GCS or the local filesystem of a server.

We recommand looking into both projects as your default options when deploying a Web Reader.

## Readium Playground

[Readium Playground](https://github.com/readium/playground) is a reference implementation of Thorium Web.

A demo is available at <https://playground.readium.org> to play with the capabilities of Readium Web and Thorium Web. Unlike a vanilla version of Thorium Web, it also provides various affordances meant to illustrate how implementers can customize the behaviour of a Web Reader.
